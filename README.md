# Sentiment-Analysis

Implementing linear classifiers for Sentiment analysis
In this project, we will implement two algorithms to train classifiers: support vector classification and logistic regression. 
The pedagogical objectives of this assignment are that you should 
* Get some experience of the practical considerations of implementing machine learning algorithms
* Understand SVC and LR more thoroughly
* Get a taste of how a typical academic paper in machine learning looks
The task here is to determine whether a product review is positive or negative. The program trains a classifier using our perceptron implementation and then evaluates the classifier on a test set.
