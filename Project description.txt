Implementing linear classifiers for Sentiment analysis
In this project, we will implement two algorithms to train classifiers: support vector classification and logistic regression. 
The pedagogical objectives of this assignment are that you should 
* Get some experience of the practical considerations of implementing machine learning algorithms
* Understand SVC and LR more thoroughly
* Get a taste of how a typical academic paper in machine learning looks
The task here is to determine whether a product review is positive or negative. The program trains a classifier using our perceptron implementation and then evaluates the classifier on a test set. 


Part 1
Implementing the SVC
* Implement the Pegasos algorithm for training support vector classifiers
* Find a good value for the regularization parameter λ and the number of training steps. For instance, In my experiments, I iterated 10 times through the training set and set λ to 1/N, where N is the number of instances in the training set. 
Logistic regression LR
* Apply difference loss function: the SVC uses the hinge loss and LR the log loss.
Part 2
Task 1. Multiclass classification
We will see how we can make your classifiers work in a situation where we have more than two possible output classes.
(a) Binarizing the multiclass problem
* Scikit-learn contains two utility classes that can help you convert multiclass classification tasks into a set of binary tasks: OneVsRestClassifier and OneVsOneClassifier. 
(b) Natively multiclass learning algorithms
* implement multiclass SVM and LR
